 # Chassis Design Files
 
 These files contain the design for the original EEEBug chassis. You can use them to design a modified chassis for your EEERover. There are three formats:
 
 - .dxf - This is a technical drawing format for CAD software
 - .svg - This is a drawing format that you can edit with vector graphics software like Inkscape. The width of lines must be set to 0.01mm for the laser cutter to interpret them as linear cuts.
 - .pdf - Your production file for the technicians should be in pdf format. Print it on paper at 100% scale to make sure the dimensions are correct. Red lines (#FF0000) are a complete cut and blue lines (#0000FF) are for engraving.

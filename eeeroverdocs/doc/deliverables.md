# Project deliverables and mark scheme

| Component 							| Weight | High Mark | Medium Mark | Low Mark |
| --------- |  --------- | --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **Interim Presentation (02/06/23)** | **20%** |
| Design progress 				| 30% | Logical division of the problem into submodules. Optimal design decisions made by evaluating alternatives against specifications. | Design decisions made but poorly justified. | Basic system design with ill-considered choice of submodules |
| Implementation progress | 30% | Progress demonstrated on all submodules, including circuti diagrams, simulations, test results, photographs and videos. Preliminary integration of submodules | Some successful implementation. Little or no integration of subsystems. | Little or weak evidence of progress |
| Planning 								| 15% | Work so far addresses all major uncertainties and risk areas. Realistic schedule for remaining work. | Main challenges identified and work underway to address them. Remaining work identified. | Significant uncertainties remain. Unrealistic or superficial plan for remaining work. |
| Teamworking 						| 15% | Work so far a joint effort from all group members. Allocation of work provides contingency for technical challenges. Cooperation on system design and interfaces between submodules | | Uneven split between group members. Little coordination on system design |
| **Reflections on professional practice (once per week)** | **5%** |
| TBD |
| **Project Report (15/06/23)** | **35%** |
| System Design | 30% | Top-level requirements refined by exploring the problem space. Definition of quantitative specifications. Division of problem into submodules. Requirements and interfaces defined for all submodules. | | Vague or incomplete specifications. Weak system-level design |
| Implementation | 30% | High-quality technical solutions for all elements of the project. Consideration of alternatives and justification for design decisions. Unambiguous documentation of the solution. | | Some design elements not documented, even if they work correctly. Doubts over referencing of research material |
| Results | 25% | High-quality evidence that solution meets all requirements at both subsystem level and top level. Appropriate tests designed. | | Testing incomplete or not relevant to specifications. Doubts over accuracy of results |
| Teamworking | 15% | Documentation of group member contributions to the project. Integrated report with consistent style and formatting. | | Sections from different authors compiled with little overall editing. Basic content on system-level design and implementation |
| **Interview and Demo (20/06/23)** | **40%** |
| Performance | 15% | Rover completes demo task quickly and accurately. | | Rover fails to complete demonstration |
| Design Quality | 35% | Implementation meets non-functional requirements. Innovative design and robust, professional implementation that demonstrates technical skill. | | Implementation hampered by poor construction quality or dubious design decisions |
| Technical understanding | 35% | All technical questions answered accurately, showing complete understanding of the design challenges and solution. | | Some aspects of the implementation cannot be explained |
| Teamworking | 15% | Evidence of group members working together to complete project. Individuals demonstrate different areas of expertise in the project. | | Contribution of some team members unclear. Technical understanding concentrated in a small number of group members |
